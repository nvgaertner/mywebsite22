<p>I am Niklas and I am 22 years old. In these 22 years I made many interesting experiences and learned a lot about all kinds of different topics. I will now tell you what you should know about my life.</p>
<div id="football" class="section level2">
<h2>Football</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to know about me is that I love <strong>football</strong>. My favorite football clubs include <em>Mainz 05</em>, <em>Borussia Dortmund</em> and <em>FC Barcelona</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="food" class="section level2">
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>The second thing you should remember about me is that I am very organized. In the following, I prepared a short and ordered list of my favorite cuisines with respective dishes as sub-items:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Italian cuisine</p>
<ul>
<li>Pasta with eggplant sauce</li>
<li>Pasta Arrabiata</li>
<li>Pizza</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Israeli cuisine</p>
<ul>
<li>Sabich</li>
<li>Shakshuka</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>For your information: Sabich is a pita sandwich which contains grilled eggplants, salad, Hummus and other dips and a boiled egg. It is mouthwateringly delicious and it is the sole reason why I need to go back to Israel for a third time.</p>
