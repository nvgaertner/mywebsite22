<h1>Climate change and temperature anomalies</h1>
<p>If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the <em>Combined
Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies</em> in the
Northern Hemisphere at <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp">NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space
Studies</a>. The <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt">tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here</a></p>
<p>To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base,
period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between
1951-1980.</p>
<p>For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of
temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide
format.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidyweather &lt;- weather %&gt;% 
  # Drop columns that are not needed
  select(Year:Dec) %&gt;% 
  # Pivot into longer format with columns 2:13 that contain the monthly data
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, 
               names_to = &quot;Month&quot;, 
               values_to = &quot;delta&quot;)</code></pre>
<div id="plotting-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Plotting Information</h2>
<p>Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a
trendline.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidyweather &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;%
  # use ymd function from lubridate package to create a date variable
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, &quot;1&quot;)),
         # Create month and year variable in the lubridate package
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

# Create plot with smoothing line
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color=&quot;red&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = &quot;Monthly Weather Anomalies&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/project1_files/figure-html/scatter_plot-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months?
Use <code>facet_wrap()</code> to produce a separate scatter plot for each month,
again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels;
that is, each month should be labeled “Jan”, “Feb”, “Mar” (full or
abbreviated month names are fine), not <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create plot
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x = date, y = delta))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color=&quot;red&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = &quot;Weather Anomalies by month&quot;) + 
  # One plot per month
  facet_wrap(~month)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/project1_files/figure-html/facet_wrap-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to
study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as
1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculates
a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980.
The code below creates a new data frame called <code>comparison</code> that groups
data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010
and 2011-present.</p>
<p>We remove data before 1800 and before using <code>filter</code>. Then, we use the
<code>mutate</code> function to create a new variable <code>interval</code> which contains
information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign
the different periods using <code>case_when()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>comparison &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;% 
  filter(Year&gt;= 1881) %&gt;%     # remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable &#39;interval&#39;, and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ &quot;1881-1920&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ &quot;1921-1950&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ &quot;1951-1980&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ &quot;1981-2010&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;2011-present&quot;
  ))</code></pre>
<p>Inspect the <code>comparison</code> dataframe by clicking on it in the
<code>Environment</code> pane.</p>
<p>Now that we have the <code>interval</code> variable, we can create a density plot
to study the distribution of monthly deviations (<code>delta</code>), grouped by
the different time periods we are interested in. Set <code>fill</code> to
<code>interval</code> to group and colour the data by different time periods.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(comparison, aes(x = delta, fill = interval)) + 
  geom_density() +
  labs (
    title = &quot;Density plot for monthly deviations&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/project1_files/figure-html/density_plot-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might
be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using
<code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarise()</code>, followed by a scatter plot to display
the result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;% 
  group_by(Year) %&gt;%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(avg_anomalies = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x = Year, y = avg_anomalies)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  # Fitting the best line using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(color = &quot;red&quot;, method = &quot;loess&quot;) + 
  # Set theme to have white background with black frame
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title = &quot;Average annual anomalies&quot;, y = &quot;Average anomaly&quot;)</code></pre>

<h2>Confidence Interval for <code>delta</code></h2>

<p>A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast

<p><strong>What is the data showing us?</strong></p>
<p>The data is showing us that there has been a significant increase in temperatures. We are 95% confident that the average increase in temperatures is between 1.02 and 1.11. For the t-distribution, we took all monthly deltas and calculated the mean and the standard deviation of this. With that, we were able to calculate the standard error and the t-value and estimate the confidence interval. For the bootstrapping simulation, we generated 1000 bootstrapped samples. The code then generated an approximate sampling distribution and calculated the confidence interval based on that. The results suggest that we have a global change of temperatures of more than 1 degree. If one also consider the average annual anomaly plot (see task before), one can clearly see that we are in a critical situation: The rise is significant and is currently increasing dramatically.</p>
